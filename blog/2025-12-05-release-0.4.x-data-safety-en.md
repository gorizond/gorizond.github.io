title: "Release 0.4.x: safer billing and workspace deletes"

In 0.3.0 we warned that deleting Billing or all Fleet workspaces could permanently wipe balances and even drop Fleet UI. The 0.4.x line fixes this with billing finalizers and safer Fleet resource handling.

<!-- truncate -->

### What changed
- v0.4.0 — Billing finalizer blocks deletion until balance is transferred; controller moves the remaining amount and keeps related Cluster resources consistent. This prevents losing funds when deleting billing.
- v0.4.1 — Reworked FleetBundle reconcile: only targeted objects are updated, unrelated resources are left intact so Fleet UI/extension stays available when cleaning workspaces.
- v0.4.2 — K3S/Headscale chart versions are configurable via environment; upgrade to the latest 0.4.2 patch is recommended.

Full notes: [v0.4.0](https://github.com/gorizond/gorizond-cluster/releases/tag/v0.4.0), [v0.4.1](https://github.com/gorizond/gorizond-cluster/releases/tag/v0.4.1), [v0.4.2](https://github.com/gorizond/gorizond-cluster/releases/tag/v0.4.2); diff [v0.3.0…v0.4.2](https://github.com/gorizond/gorizond-cluster/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.2).

### How to upgrade
- In your GitOps/Fleet bundle set `chartVersion` of `gorizond-cluster-controller` to `0.4.2` (tag `v0.4.2`).
- Roll out via Fleet/Helm and wait for `BundleDeployment` to reach `Ready` and controller pods to restart.

### How to verify
- When attempting to delete a Billing with balance, the resource stays `Terminating` until the controller transfers the balance; funds are preserved.
- After deleting a test Fleet workspace, the Fleet extension in Rancher remains available; other workspaces can still be created/deleted.
- Controller logs are clean for Billing/FleetBundle reconcile; probes/metrics stay green.
