Simple billing

<!-- truncate -->

Add billing CRDs and controller logic for handling billing events and cluster billing status updates. This includes:

1. New CRDs for Billing and BillingEvent resources
2. Controller logic to:
    - Track cluster billing status
    - Generate periodic billing events
    - Process billing events to update balances
4. Configuration options to enable/disable billing controller
5. Dependency updates and cleanup

Current Issues:

- You can delete billing and lose the entire balance, including both positive and negative balances.
- When deleting all fleet workspaces, the user loses the fleet UI, resulting in the inability to create or delete fleet workspaces anymore.
