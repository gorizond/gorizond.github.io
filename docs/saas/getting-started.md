SaaS is live at [https://gorizond.negash.ru/dashboard](https://gorizond.negash.ru/dashboard). This page explains how to register, what is created automatically, the current free-tier limits, and how billing via `yookassa-url-generator` removes the 1-worker cap. A self-hosted edition will be documented separately later.

## Pricing {#pricing}
- Free tier: Kubernetes API clusters with a **1 worker** limit; operator only warns if exceeded.
- Paid: attach billing via `yookassa-url-generator` webhook to lift the 1-worker cap (plan limits apply).

## What you get today
- Self-service signup with immediate console access.
- An isolated workspace is created for every new user with **admin** rights at the Fleet workspace level.
- Billing record: created when payment is attached via the webhook to `yookassa-url-generator`; until then the workspace runs in free mode.
- Free tier: you can create Kubernetes API clusters with a **1 worker** limit. The operator currently only logs a warning if extra workers are added; automatic enforcement is not enabled yet.

## Registration
1) Go to [https://gorizond.negash.ru/dashboard](https://gorizond.negash.ru/dashboard) and click **Sign up**.
2) Complete signup; you are redirected into your workspace with admin rights.
3) Each user gets their own workspace. Team invites will be added later; for now keep using the auto-created workspace.

## Working on the free tier
- Create clusters from the UI as usual. The free plan allows up to one worker per cluster until billing is attached.
- If you add more workers, the operator currently only records a warning in logs. Please respect the limit to avoid future auto-enforcement actions once enabled.

### Manage clusters via the Gorizond extension
- Open the **Gorizond** app in Rancher (Global Apps → Gorizond). The extension lists your clusters inside the workspace namespace.
- You can create/import clusters from here; the free tier still enforces the 1-worker expectation.

### Check billing state
- In the same extension, open **Billings** to see workspace billing objects. Balance shows current credit/debt, and **Top Up** triggers the payment flow (webhook to `yookassa-url-generator`).

### Trigger a payment link
- Click **Top Up** in the billing table. Enter amount and click **Top up on Yookassa** — this calls the webhook in `yookassa-url-generator` and returns a payment URL.

## Attach billing to lift the limit
Payments are processed through a webhook pointing to `yookassa-url-generator`. After successful payment the workspace switches to paid mode and the 1-worker cap is lifted (other limits depend on the plan).

Steps:
1) In the UI, request a payment link (Billing section). If the UI action is temporarily missing, ask support for a link.
2) Receive the payment URL generated by `yookassa-url-generator`.
3) Pay the invoice. The webhook will attach your workspace to the paid billing record.
4) Create or scale clusters without the 1-worker restriction (subject to plan limits).

## What’s next
- Self-hosted docs will follow; this page only covers the SaaS edition.
- Expect updates once automated enforcement and additional plan limits are enabled.
